<h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
<br>

A fully functional Tic Tac Toe web game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project demonstrates core front-end development skills including DOM manipulation, game logic implementation, and responsive UI design.


<h1>📌 Features</h1>

🎯 Two-player game (Player X vs Player O)

🧠 Automatic win detection logic

🤝 Draw detection

🔄 Restart / Reset game button

📱 Responsive design (works on mobile & desktop)

🎨 Clean and minimal UI

<h1>🛠️ Technologies Used</h1>

HTML5 – Structure of the game

CSS3 – Styling and layout

JavaScript (ES6) – Game logic and interactivity

<h1>🧠 How the Game Works</h1>

The game board consists of a 3×3 grid.

Players take turns placing their marks (X or O).

JavaScript checks for:

Horizontal wins

Vertical wins

Diagonal wins

If all 9 cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.

The Reset button restarts the game.
